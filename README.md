TS Luxon is a library for working with dates and times in Javscript and Typescript.

This repo was initially created by [GillesDebunne]([initial-autor]) which of course started from [Luxon]([original-luxon]) itself.

Many thanks to both of them for this fantastic work. 

I decided to fork his work, because we don't know for sure if and when Luxon will adopt this source.

I realized moment wasn't suitable anymore for my projects, but I couldn't wait to have a more stable version and at this time Luxon (v 1.25.0) had structural issues, which resulted in errors in my Angular projects.

## Upgrading to 5.x
Compared to v4 here I only changed how the library is built and the outputs.
It should be completely transparent to the user given the adjustments to the package.json and given the fact that the es6 export of v4 is **interpreted as CJS anyways**.
I'm working on adding a real ESM module output to v5, but it seems there's no way of making the two cohexist.

## Upgrading to 4.x

See the [docs page](https://tonysamperi.github.io/ts-luxon/docs)

```js
DateTime.now().setZone('America/New_York').minus({ weeks: 1 }).endOf('day').toISO();
```

## Features
 * DateTime, Duration, and Interval types.
 * Immutable, chainable, unambiguous API.
 * Parsing and formatting for common and custom formats.
 * Native time zone and Intl support (no locale or tz files).

## Usage

### Via npm

`npm i ts-luxon --save`

then

```typescript
import {DateTime} from "ts-luxon";

const myDto = DateTime.local();
```

### Bundle / UMD

You can download the umd bundle from here:

* [ts-luxon.umd.js](https://unpkg.com/ts-luxon@latest/dist/ts-luxon.umd.js)
