# For Moment users

Luxon borrows lots of ideas from [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com), but there are a lot of differences too. This document clarifies what they are.

## Immutability

Luxon's objects are immutable, whereas Moment's are mutable. For example, in Moment:

```js
var m1 = moment();
var m2 = m1.add(1, 'hours');
m1.valueOf() === m2.valueOf(); //=> true
```

This happens because `m1` and `m2` are really the same object; `add()` *mutated* the object to be an hour later. Compare that to Luxon:

```js
var d1 = DateTime.now();
var d2 = d1.plus({ hours: 1 });
d1.valueOf() === d2.valueOf(); //=> false
```

This happens because the `plus` method returns a new instance, leaving `d1` unmodified. It also means that Luxon doesn't require copy constructors or clone methods.

## Major functional differences

1. Months in Luxon are 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed like in Moment and the native Date type.
1. Localizations and time zones are implemented by the native Intl API (or a polyfill of it), instead of by the library itself.
1. Luxon has both a Duration type and an Interval type. The Interval type is like Twix.

## Other API style differences

1. Luxon methods often take option objects as their last parameter
1. Luxon has different static methods for object creation (e.g. `fromISO`), as opposed to Moment's one function that dispatches based on the input
1. Luxon parsers are very strict, whereas Moment's are more lenient.
1. Luxon uses getters instead of accessor methods, so `dateTime.year` instead of `dateTime.year()`
1. Luxon centralizes its "setters", like `dateTime.set({year: 2016, month: 4})` instead of `dateTime.year(2016).month(4)` like in Moment.
1. Luxon's Durations are a separate top-level class.
1. Arguments to Luxon's methods are not automatically coerced into Luxon instances. E.g. `m.diff('2017-04-01')` would be `dt.diff(DateTime.fromISO('2017-04-01'))`.

## DateTime method equivalence

Here's a rough mapping of DateTime methods in Moment to ones in Luxon. I haven't comprehensively documented stuff that's in Luxon but not in Moment, just a few odds and ends that seemed obvious for inclusion; there are more. I've probably missed a few things too.

### Creation

| From RFC 2822           | `moment(String)`         | `DateTime.fromRFC2822(String)`        |                                                                                                                                       |
| From custom format      | `moment(String, String)` | `DateTime.fromFormat(String, String)` | The format tokens differ between Moment and Luxon, such that the same format string cannot be used between the two.                   |
| From object             | `moment(Object)`         | `DateTime.fromObject(Object)`         |                                                                                                                                       |

| From UTC civil time     | `moment.utc(Array)`      | `DateTime.utc(Number...)`             | Moment also uses `moment.utc()` to take other arguments. In Luxon, use the appropriate method and pass in the `{ zone: 'utc'}` option |

| Use the string's offset | `parseZone`              | See note                              | Methods taking strings that can specify offset or zone take a `setZone` argument                                                      |

#### Programmatic get and set

For programmatic getting and setting, Luxon and Moment are very similar here:

| Operation  | Moment                | Luxon         | Notes                                   |

| set value  | `set(String, Number)` | None          |                                         |
| set values | `set(Object)`         | `set(Object)` | Like `dt.set({ year: 2016, month: 3 })` |

| Duration         | `diff(Moment)` | `diff(DateTime)`            | Moment's diff returns a count of milliseconds, but Luxon's returns a Duration. To replicate the Moment behavior, use `dt1.diff(d2).milliseconds`. |

#### Humanization

Luxon has `toRelative` and `toRelativeCalendar`. For internationalization, they use Intl.RelativeTimeFormat (or fall back to English when it is not supported by the browser).

| Operation            | Moment         | Luxon                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Time from now        | `fromNow()`    | `toRelative()`                                |
| Time from other time | `from(Moment)` | `toRelative({ base: DateTime })`              |
| Time to now          | `toNow()`      | `DateTime.local().toRelative({ base: this })` |
| Time to other time   | `to(Moment)`   | `otherTime.toRelative({ base: this })`        |
| "Calendar time"      | `calendar()`   | `toRelativeCalendar()`                        |

## Durations

Moment Durations and Luxon Durations are broadly similar in purpose and capabilities. The main differences are:

1.  Luxon durations have more sophisticated conversion capabilities. They can convert from one set of units to another using `shiftTo`. They can also be configured to use different unit conversions. See [Duration Math](math.md?id=duration-math) for more.
1.  Luxon does not (yet) have an equivalent of Moment's Duration `humanize` method. Luxon will add that when [Intl.UnitFormat](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-unit-format) is supported by browsers.
1.  Like DateTimes, Luxon Durations have separate methods for creating objects from different sources.

See the `Duration` API docs for more.

## Intervals

Moment doesn't have direct support intervals, which must be provided by plugins like Twix or moment-range. Luxon's Intervals have similar capabilities to theirs, with the exception of the humanization features. See the `Interval` API docs for more.
